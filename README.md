# Summary

This project aims to develop an AI-powered platform to detect suspicious luxury brand purchases and prevent money laundering. The system will analyze customer behavior and identify patterns that indicate money laundering, alerting authorities for further investigation.
Background

Money laundering is a significant problem that undermines financial institutions, facilitates criminal activities, and damages the economy. Luxury brand retailers are often targeted due to the high value of their products. This project aims to mitigate these risks by providing a tool that detects suspicious transactions, helping retailers comply with legal requirements and protect their reputation.

    Corruption of financial institutions
    Facilitation of criminal activities
    Economic and social inequity

# How is it used?

The AI platform is used by luxury brand retailers to monitor customer transactions for suspicious activities. The process involves:

    Data Collection: Gathering data on customer purchase patterns and transactions.
    Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing the data for analysis.
    Feature Engineering: Selecting relevant features for the neural network.
    Model Training: Training the neural network to detect unusual purchase patterns.
    Model Evaluation: Testing the model's accuracy and efficiency.
    Model Implementation: Deploying the model to detect suspicious transactions in real-time.

This is how you create code examples:

python

import numpy as np
from keras.models import Sequential
from keras.layers import Dense

# Load and preprocess the data
X_train = np.load('X_train.npy')
y_train = np.load('y_train.npy')
X_test = np.load('X_test.npy')
y_test = np.load('y_test.npy')

# Create the neural network model
model = Sequential()
model.add(Dense(64, input_dim=X_train.shape[1], activation='relu'))
model.add(Dense(32, activation='relu'))
model.add(Dense(1, activation='sigmoid'))

# Compile the model
model.compile(loss='binary_crossentropy', optimizer='adam', metrics=['accuracy'])

# Train the model
model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=50, batch_size=32, validation_data=(X_test, y_test))

# Evaluate the model
loss, acc = model.evaluate(X_test, y_test, verbose=0)
print('Test Accuracy: %.3f' % acc)

Data sources and AI methods

The data comes from customer transactions provided by luxury brand retailers. The platform uses machine learning algorithms and neural networks to analyze the data and detect suspicious patterns.

Challenges

The project does not solve all aspects of money laundering and has limitations such as access to transaction data from stores and banks. Ethical considerations include ensuring data privacy and compliance with legal regulations.
What next?

To advance the project, further skills in AI, machine learning, data analytics, and cybersecurity are needed. Collaboration with luxury brands, financial institutions, and regulatory bodies is essential for success.
